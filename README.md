# Weather Dashboard

This is a weather dashboard designed to allow you to see the weather in any city you wish to view the weather in multiple cities. These cities are not random but selected by the user. Searching for an city on the globe will show you the current and future weather in that city and your past searches will be saved in local storage for later use.

## What Information Does This Application Show?

To get an accurate assessment if the weather is suitable for travel (or to plan what to bring) you need to consider all of the weather conditions you are going to encounter on your trip. This dashboard will display the temperature, weather conditions, humidity, UV index, and wind speed. With all of these factors in mind, you can plan your trip to be as comfortable as possible.
